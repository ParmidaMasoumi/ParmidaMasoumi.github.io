## Publications (Expanded)

1. **Mitigating acid attack-induced deterioration of cement mortar through the application of montmorillonite nanosheets**:  
   This study examines the effectiveness of montmorillonite nanosheets in enhancing the resistance of cement mortar to acid-induced deterioration. By incorporating these nanosheets, the research highlights a promising approach to reducing material breakdown in acidic environments, potentially contributing to more durable and resilient infrastructure.  
   _Under Review in Construction and Building Materials journal._

2. **The potential of nano-clay to minimize degradation in Portland cement-zeolite binary mortar exposed to alkali-silica reaction (ASR)**:  
   This research investigates the role of nano-clay in limiting the degradation caused by alkali-silica reaction (ASR) in Portland cement-zeolite mortar. ASR can lead to significant structural damage due to expansion and cracking; therefore, the addition of nano-clay presents a valuable strategy for enhancing concrete durability, particularly in ASR-prone applications.
